## üìñ Project Overview

This project follows a structured approach to tackle the time series forecasting problem:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and performing feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
2. **Modeling**: Implementing and training several models, from simple baselines to more complex deep learning architectures.
3. **Evaluation & Comparison**: Assessing model performance using relevant metrics and comparing their strengths and weaknesses.
4. **Submission**: Generating predictions on the test set for the Kaggle challenge.
